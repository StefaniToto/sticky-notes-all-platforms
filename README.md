- ☁️ **Cloud Storage**: Secure data storage with Firebase

## Platforms

- **Mobile**: Android & iOS (Ionic Capacitor)
- **Desktop**: Windows, macOS, Linux (Electron)
- **Web**: Progressive Web App
- **Backend**: Firebase for real-time synchronization

## Getting Started

### Current Status

✅ **Project Structure Setup Complete**
- Monorepo structure with shared library
- Angular web application configured
- Ionic mobile application configured  
- Electron desktop application configured
- Firebase backend configuration ready
- TypeScript models and services implemented

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- For mobile development: Ionic CLI, Android Studio, Xcode

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sticky-notes-all-platforms.git
cd sticky-notes-all-platforms
```

2. Install all dependencies:
```bash
npm run install:all
```

3. Build the shared library:
```bash
cd shared && npm run build
```

### Firebase Setup

Before running the applications, you'll need to set up Firebase:

1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Enable Authentication, Firestore Database, and Cloud Messaging
3. Create a web app in your Firebase project
4. Copy the Firebase configuration and add it to each platform:
   - Web: `web/src/environments/environment.ts`
   - Mobile: `mobile/src/environments/environment.ts`
   - Desktop: Create `desktop/src/firebase-config.js`

5. Deploy Firebase rules and indexes:
```bash
cd firebase
firebase login
firebase use --add  # Select your project
firebase deploy --only firestore
```

### Running the Applications

After setup is complete, you can run each platform:

**Desktop (Electron):**
```bash
npm run dev:desktop
```

**Mobile (Ionic):**
```bash
npm run dev:mobile
```

**Web (Angular):**
```bash
npm run dev:web
```

```

## Development

This is a monorepo where each platform shares common business logic through the `shared` library. Any changes to the shared library require rebuilding it before the changes are reflected in the applications.

### Desktop Development
- Built with **Electron**
- Cross-platform compatibility for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Native system integration for notifications
- Uses shared TypeScript models and services

### Mobile Development
- Built with **Angular + Ionic + Capacitor**
- Native mobile features integration
- Push notifications support
- Shared codebase with web application

### Web Development
- Built with **Angular**
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Offline capability with service workers
- Firebase integration for real-time sync

### Shared Library
- **TypeScript** models and interfaces
- **Firebase** service configurations  
- Common utilities and constants
- Platform-agnostic business logic

### Development Workflow

1. Make changes to shared library: `cd shared && npm run build`
2. Develop platform-specific features in respective directories
3. Test across all platforms before committing
